# Storm Effects

This report examines six decades (1950-2011) of storm event data from the U.S. [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration](https://www.noaa.gov/) (NOAA) Storm Database. The purpose of this study is to answer two questions related to the effects of storm events. Both questions consider storm events at a national scale in the United States. The first question pertains to population health effects of storms, as defined by injuries and fatalities. The total number of injuries and fatalities from tornadoes, heat, wind, flood, thunderstorms, and winter storms rate the highest need for concern. The second question pertains to economic consequences of storms, as defined by crop damage and property damage. The total dollar amount of crop damage and property damage from floods, wind, tornadoes, and hail rate the highest need for concern. Attention should be given to the three storm types on both lists: tornadoes, wind, and floods.
